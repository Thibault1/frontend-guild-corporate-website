**Belgium meet Tech Guild.**

In 2019 we started as a community of frontend developers, hence the name Frontend Guild. We were on a mission to support the digital transformation of our clients with our frontend development expertise. 
\
\
We became a trusted partner of a wide client base spanning industries such as the media, ecommerce, real estate and banking. To achieve their digital goals, we needed to support them, not only with frontend development expertise, but with a broad range of skills, so they could deliver faster and better enterprise-scale apps & services. 
\
\
So over time, it became clear that we could support our clients much better, if we offered a wider range of services.
\
\
\
**Today our name catches up.**

Today our name catches up with the broader scope of services that we are offering, by including more technologies into our company we meet the expectations of our clients. 
\
\
The guilds will allow our engineers to thrive and grow professionally, each guild will provide a platform to share ideas and expertise, offering real-world knowledge about the latest trends and will provide excellent opportunities to learn from each other. 
\
\
Our name and logo may have changed, but our mission to create quality software - remains the same.
\
\

Sincerely - Tech Guild
